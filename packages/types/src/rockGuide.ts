/**
 * The Rock tab's field guide: what each rock is, how it formed, how that made
 * its holds, what rain and sun do to it, and how to look after it.
 *
 * **`formed` and `holds` are sourced, sentence by sentence.** Each was checked
 * against a page actually read — the table is in `rock-drying-research.md`
 * beside §7 — and says no more than that page does (owner, 2026-09-29:
 * "Don't make up shit").
 *
 * **General knowledge about a rock type, not a reading of this crag.** Nothing
 * here is measured at the location; the tab says so. The claims follow
 * `.claude/docs/rock-drying-research.md` (§2.4 wet strength, §3 porosity, §3.1
 * friction, §4 per-family notes, §10 corrections) and carry no figure that §10
 * could not source.
 *
 * **`dries` is a band of the drying table, not a copy of it.** The hours live
 * only in `dryingModel.ts` (`MIN_HOURS`/`MAX_HOURS`); `dryingModel.test.ts`
 * holds every row here to the band its `MAX_HOURS` falls in, so the words on
 * this tab cannot drift from the clock the score runs on.
 *
 * **`unknown` has no guide.** It means nobody recorded the rock, and a profile
 * for it would describe a rock that may not be there.
